Loan Approval Prediction: Binary classification task to predict loan approvals using a dataset of financial and demographic features. Conducted data preprocessing, feature engineering, and normalization with StandardScaler. Performed exploratory data analysis and tested models, selecting Gaussian Naive Bayes for its efficiency and high recall (92%) for approvals. Achieved 74% accuracy and 82% F1-score for the positive class. Deployed the model via Flask for web application integration.
